## Description

Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process, and this repository aims to provide practical examples and solutions to common challenges encountered when working with real-world datasets. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data analyst, these notebooks will help you sharpen your data manipulation skills and make more informed decisions based on your data.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you'll need Python and the following libraries installed:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You can install these libraries using pip:
but they should already be AVAILABLE via anaconda.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn
