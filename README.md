This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the various data wrangling, cleaning, and processing techniques I have learnt through my Completion of SIT220 â€“ Data wrangling. The resources completed cover crucial topics such as handling missing values, data transformation, and data aggregation. It showcases as a guide for the work I have completed in relation to looking to improve my data handling skills and gain hands-on experience in working with diverse yet dynamic datasets.

## Description

Data wrangling is a crucial step in the data analysis process, and this repository aims to provide practical examples and solutions to common challenges encountered when working with real-world datasets. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced data analyst, these notebooks will help you sharpen your data manipulation skills and make more informed decisions based on your data.

## Installation

To run the notebooks and scripts in this repository, you'll need Python and the following libraries installed:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You can install these libraries using pip:
but they should already be AVAILABLE via anaconda.

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn
